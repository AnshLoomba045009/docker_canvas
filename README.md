Introduction
Grafana is an open-source platform for monitoring and observability. It integrates with various data sources such as Prometheus, MySQL, and PostgreSQL, and provides powerful features to visualize metrics, logs, and other time-series data in the form of interactive dashboards. This project sets up Grafana using Docker to make it easy to run the platform in an isolated and portable environment.

This repository contains the configuration and steps required to run Grafana in Docker.

Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure that you have the following installed:

Docker (version 19.03 or higher)
A working internet connection to download the Docker image
Installation
To get started with Grafana in Docker, follow these steps:

Pull Command
First, pull the Grafana Docker image from Docker Hub:

bash
Copy code
docker pull grafana/grafana
This command will download the Grafana Docker image to your system.

Run Command
Once the image is downloaded, you can run Grafana as a Docker container. Execute the following command:

bash
Copy code
docker run --name grafana -p 3000:3000 -d grafana/grafana
--name grafana: Assigns the name "grafana" to the running container.
-p 3000:3000: Maps port 3000 inside the container (Grafanaâ€™s default port) to port 3000 on your local machine, allowing you to access Grafana at http://localhost:3000.
-d: Runs the container in detached mode (background).
Usage
After running the container, Grafana will be available at http://localhost:3000. You can now use Grafana to create and manage dashboards, visualize time-series data, and integrate it with various data sources.

Accessing the Application
Open your web browser.
Go to http://localhost:3000.
The Grafana login page will appear.
Username: admin
Password: admin
Once logged in, you can begin setting up your dashboards and connecting data sources to monitor metrics and visualize performance data.

Troubleshooting
Container Not Starting
If the container fails to start, ensure that Docker is installed and running correctly on your machine. You can check the container logs for any errors by running:

bash
Copy code
docker logs grafana
Port Conflicts
If port 3000 is already in use by another service on your machine, you can change the port mapping by modifying the -p flag in the docker run command. For example, to use port 4000 instead:

bash
Copy code
docker run --name grafana -p 4000:3000 -d grafana/grafana
This would make Grafana accessible at http://localhost:4000.
